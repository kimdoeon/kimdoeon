👋  I'm doeon, a Master's student in Graduate school of AI at [Soongsil University](https://ssu.ac.kr/), where I'm advised by Prof. Sungshin Kim in the SmartAILab and Seongheum Kim in the VIP Lab. My research interest is vision transformer in **EMF Prediction**📡 and **tiny object detection**🔍. I have recently become interested in **multimodal deep learning for EMF Prediction**
