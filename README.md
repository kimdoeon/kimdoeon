👋  I'm doeon, a Master's student in Graduate school of AI at [Soongsil University](https://ssu.ac.kr/), where I'm advised by Prof. Sungshin Kim in the SmartAILab and 
Seongheum Kim in the VIP Lab. My research interest is vision transformer in **EMF Prediction**📡 and **tiny object detection**🔍. I have recently become interested in **multimodal deep learning for EMF Prediction**

## 📂 Projects and Experiences

- **[ShowMyWorld in Korean](https://github.com/ShowMyWorldInKorean/visualTranslation)** *(02.2025-present)*<br/>
This project focuses on Scene Text-to-Scene Text Translation, where English/Korean text in signboard images is translated into Korean/English and naturally reinserted into the image. I am responsible for ensuring translation accuracy and preserving contextual meaning using translation models.

- **[EMF(Electronic MagneticField) Prediction](https://github.com/kimdoeon/emf_project)** *(05.2024년-present)*<br/>
Vision Transformer-Based EMF Prediction in 5G Networks. Applied transformer models (ViT, Swin, HRFormer, Mask2Former) to predict electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure in 5G environments, improving accuracy over traditional measurement-based methods.

- **[Watch list filtering](https://github.com/kimdoeon/wlf_project)** *(05.2024-02.2025)*<br/>
This project focuses on identifying watchlisted individuals by measuring the embedding similarity between names using a natural language model. A BERT-based model for Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) was utilized to extract character-level name embeddings and evaluate their similarity through Cosine Similarity. I was responsible for modeling, overall project management.

- **[SKT FLY AI Challenger 4기](https://github.com/FLYAI4)** *(12.2023-02.2024)*<br/>
SKT FLY AI is an AI talent development and support program hosted by SK Telecom, offering opportunities to explore deep learning, machine learning, data science, and MLOps while gaining hands-on experience in AI technologies. Our team developed an application utilizing ChatGPT and generative AI to provide artwork descriptions and key appreciation points in museums, enhancing the visitor experience.
